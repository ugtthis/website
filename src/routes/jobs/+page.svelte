      <i>Solve self driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries</i>.
    </h4>

    <p>
      We're building the robotics stack that will solve self driving cars, then eventually scales to all of robotics. We own our stack from shipping state of the art <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAWScxZuc0g&amp;pp=ygUQY29tbWEgY29uIGhhcmFsZA%3D%3D">machine learning models</a> trained on our own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJWsrPnfrgo">infrastructure</a>, building the <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">operating system</a>, designing the <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/comma3X/">hardware</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-jdEgvLb-A">manufacturing</a> it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, our fleet is the second largest after Tesla, and it's growing every month as more of the 10+ million compatible cars on the road come online.
      We will win by continuing to ship a better product and better driving to our users. No hype, just shipping constant incremental progress until your comma reliably drives you to <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/taco-bell/">Taco Bell</a>.

      comma is 25 people across <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/refactoring-for-growth/">three teams</a>:
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong class="highlight-green">autonomy team</strong> builds the autonomous agent software, along with all of the infrastructure needed for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong class="highlight-green">product team</strong> designs and manufactures the product, including the hardware, low-level software needed to run the agent software, as well the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong class="highlight-green">operations team</strong> builds and maintains company infrastructure, including money, people, and logistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operations and product teams work together to ship you the comma four, and the autonomy and product teams ship openpilot to run on your comma four.
    </p>

  comma is a profitable consumer electronics business. For every dollar we make, half goes to building comma fours and half goes to engineering to improve the product.

  No advertising, MBAs, or agenda beyond solving self-driving cars.

    <h4>Who we're looking for</h4>
    <pre>
  We don't care where, or even if, you went to school. We don't care if you have a traditional background. We're just looking for people who can independently contribute to shipping openpilot.

  We love a great GitHub, open source contributors, good projects, and competition winners.

  Prove your skills with either of these:
  1. <a href="https://comma.ai/bounties">Bounties</a>: contribute to our open source projects while getting paid
  2. <a href="https://comma.ai/leaderboard">Challenges</a>: we made challenges for design, controls, hardware, and more.

  <strong>2. Phone screen</strong>
  Typically, we do two phone calls. A quick intro and screen, then an in-depth technical interview with an engineer.

  <strong>3. Paid Micro-internship</strong>
  We'll fly you out to meet the team and work on a real problem for a few days. In most cases, the project will be scoped such that you'll ship it to real users by the end.

  If all goes well, we'll make you a full-time job offer.
